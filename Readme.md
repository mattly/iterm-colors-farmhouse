# Farmhouse Theme, iTerm2 Edition

Farmhouse is a color theme I created after having severe eye fatigue issues with a popular "Mathematically Perfect" color scheme that was too dim, and then another [color scheme of my own creation][pencil-iterm] that after a while I found too bright.

The color values are hand-picked and not perfectly balanced, yet I think quite pleasing to the eye.  The name *farmhouse* is derived from the [beer style of the same name][farmhouse-beer], one of the few styles where the fermentation process isn't strictly controlled.
